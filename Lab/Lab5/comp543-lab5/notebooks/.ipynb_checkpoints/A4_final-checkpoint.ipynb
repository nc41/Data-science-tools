Changes in medical practice that limit instruction time and patient availability, the expanding options for diagnosis and management, and advances in technology are contributing to greater use of simulation technology in medical education. Four areas of high-technology simulations currently being used are laparoscopic techniques, which provide surgeons with an opportunity to enhance their motor skills without risk to patients; a cardiovascular disease simulator, which can be used to simulate cardiac conditions; multimedia computer systems, which includes patient-centered, case-based programs that constitute a generalist curriculum in cardiology; and anesthesia simulators, which have controlled responses that vary according to numerous possible scenarios. Some benefits of simulation technology include improvements in certain surgical technical skills, in cardiovascular examination skills, and in acquisition and retention of knowledge compared with traditional lectures. These systems help to address the problem of poor skills training and proficiency and may provide a method for physicians to become self-directed lifelong learners.'))\n",

With the acceptance of chemoradiotherapy as the new primary treatment for patients with locally advanced squamous-cell head and neck cancers, and the increasing numbers of patients who achieve a complete response, the role of planned neck dissection is now being questioned. The accuracy and availability of a physical examination or of different imaging modalities to identify true complete responses adds controversy to this issue.

No major intracranial vessels had been injured and there was no significant intraparenchymal haemorrhage. Death was due to haemorrhage from self-inflicted stab wounds to the abdomen with an associated penetrating intracranial wound from a power drill. Deaths due to power drills are rare and are either accidents or suicides. Wounds caused by power drills may be mistaken for bullet entrance wounds, and the marks around a wound from the drill chuck as muzzle imprints.
